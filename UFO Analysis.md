# UFO

#### Project

In this assignment we have been asked to use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. The created table should also have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria.

The language being used to improve webpages by enhancing the user experience, providing front-end functionality, customization, dashboards. This will also have provisions for taking user input so that the created web pages are dynamic in nature.

#### Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Results

- The webpage is user friendly and allows users to filter the data on verious criteria like date, shape, city and state
- The filters are dynamic in nature
- The data connected is live and displaying real time data
- One can further drill down the data to narrow down the search to a specific requirement
- One can apply multiple filter at a time

## Summary

We would like to summarize the entire analysis into two parts : Drawbacks and Recommendation

#### Drawbacks :
- The date filter should have been more user-friendly. For example, a calender would have helped in selecting the date 

#### Recommendations :
1. The wildcard search would have helped to access the state, city, shape directly. 
2. There is no provision to search the duration and comments fields on the table. For example, some of the sightings have exact durations listed (6 minutes), while others are less precise (dawn until dusk).
